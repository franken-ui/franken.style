## Overview

Frankenstyle is a **no-build, value-driven, utility-first CSS framework**.

It takes inspiration from Tailwind CSS but simplifies setup by **removing the need for a build pipeline**. No PostCSS, no config files, no `vite.config.js`. Just drop in the CSS via CDN and start styling.

At its core, Frankenstyle provides:

* **Utility-first syntax** (similar to Tailwind CSS)
* **Lightweight, value-driven styling** (utilities paired with CSS variables you define)
* **Runtime state generation** (`:hover`, `:active`, etc.)
* **Responsive and theme-aware design**

## Philosophy

Frankenstyle is built around a few guiding principles:

### 1. No build process

Everything is pre-compiled and can be consumed via CDN. No bundler, no file watchers, no CLI, no config.

### 2. Value-driven utilities

Instead of bundling hundreds of pre-defined classes (`m-2`, `m-4`, `p-6`), Frankenstyle uses **generic utility names** (`m`, `p`, `bg`) paired with **CSS custom properties** that you define.

| Usage              | Purpose             |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| `class="p"`        | Apply padding       |
| `style="--p: 4"`   | Define its value    |

You don't need to memorize odd variable names. Just drop special characters from the class:

| Class Name         | Variable Name        |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| `sm:m`             | `--sm-m`             |
| `dark:sm:bg:hover` | `--dark-sm-bg-hover` |

### 3. Explicit, intentional styling

Utility classes and their values should always go together. This prevents accidental styling and enforces intentional design.

### 4. Runtime state generation

Hover, focus, and other states aren't shipped in a large CSS bundle. Frankenstyle **generates state CSS at runtime**, when and where it's needed.

### 5. Familiar but simplified

The syntax feels like Tailwind (`sm:`, `md:`, `dark:`), but values are fully customizable and declarative.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Value-driven utilities

Frankenstyle provides the utility class, and you provide the value:

<Ec path="introduction.0" />

* Base spacing is multiplied by `var(--spacing)` to keep values consistent.
* Arbitrary values are supported using bracket syntax:

<Ec path="introduction.1" />

### 2. State management (`:hover`, `:active`)

Frankenstyle generates states dynamically at runtime. Enable this by adding the `data-uk` attribute:

<Ec path="introduction.2" />

| Class Name       | Purpose                   |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| `bg:hover`       | Hover background          |
| `dark:bg:hover`  | Dark mode hover background |

Works with any color utilities (`color`, `border`, `fill`, etc.).

### 3. Responsive design

Frankenstyle follows Tailwind's responsive prefixes:

| Prefix  | Breakpoint       |
|---------|------------------|
| `sm:`   | Small            |
| `md:`   | Medium           |
| `lg:`   | Large            |
| `xl:`   | Extra large      |
| `2xl:`  | 2x Extra large   |

<Ec path="introduction.3" />

### 4. Opacity handling

Opacity is controlled with the `/o` suffix and requires two variables:

<Ec path="introduction.4" />

This ensures explicit opacity control and avoids inheritance issues.

## Conclusion

Frankenstyle is intentionally simple: a single stylesheet, optional runtime script, and a straightforward utility system designed for clarity and control.
