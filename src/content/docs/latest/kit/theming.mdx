FrankenstyleKit uses a simple background and foreground convention for colors. Take a look at the following CSS variables:

<Ec project="kit" path="theming.1" />

The background color of the following component will be `oklch(27.4% 0.006 286.033)` and the foreground color will be `oklch(98.5% 0 0)`.

<Ec project="kit" path="theming.2" />

## List of variables

Here's the list of variables available for customization:

<Ec project="kit" path="theming.3" />

## Adding new colors

To add new colors, simply add them to your main CSS file.

<Ec project="kit" path="theming.22" />

You can now use it via utility class in your components.

<Ec project="kit" path="theming.16" />

## Custom palette

**1\.** Start by going to [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors) and pick your desired color. Use that color to assign values to the `--uk-primary`, `--uk-primary-f`, and `--uk-focus` tokens. These tokens represent your main theme color, its contrasting foreground color, and the focus color. 

**2\.** Use the CSS snippet below as your starting point and replace the * with your theme name (e.g. indigo, cyan, fuchsia, etc.). You only need to update the values for `--uk-primary`, `--uk-primary-f`, and `--uk-focus` for both light and dark modes, but you're free to customize everything else if needed.

<Ec project="kit" path="theming.23" />

## Setting the default palette

To set your newly added palette as the default, simply update the script in your `<head>` tag to reference the new theme name, like so:

<Ec project="kit" path="theming.21" />

## Adding to LSH

To register your newly added palette with the [LSH](/docs/latest/kit/lsh#custom-groups) component, please refer to the corresponding documentation or guide for step-by-step instructions on how to integrate it.
