import Ec from 'snippets/ec.astro';


import Snippet from "snippets/component.astro";

Drag and drop an element to a new location within the sortable grid, while the other items adjust to fit. This is great, if you want to sort items like gallery or menu items, for example.

## Usage

To apply this component, add the `data-uk-sortable` attribute to a container and create child elements.

<Ec project="kit" path="sortable.1" />

<Snippet project="kit" component="sortable.basic" />

## Handle

By default, the entire sortable element can be used for drag and drop sorting. To create a handle which will be used instead, just add the `handle: SELECTOR` option to the attribute and add the handle class to the element that you want to use as a handle.

<Ec project="kit" path="sortable.2" />

<Snippet project="kit" component="sortable.handle" />

## Group

To be able to sort items from one list to another, you can group them by adding the `group: GROUP-NAME` option to the `data-uk-sortable` attribute on each list.

<Ec project="kit" path="sortable.3" />

<Snippet project="kit" component="sortable.group" />

## Custom class

You can also apply one or more custom classes to items when they are being dragged. To do so, add the `cls-custom: MY-CLASS` option to the attribute.

<Ec project="kit" path="sortable.4" />

<Snippet project="kit" component="sortable.custom_class" />

## Component options

Any of these options can be applied to the component attribute. Separate multiple options with a semicolon. [Learn more](/docs/2.1/javascript#component-configuration)
