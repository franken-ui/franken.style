## Usage

The Accordion component consists of a parent container with the `data-uk-accordion` attribute, and a title and content part for each accordion item.

| Class                   | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.uk-accordion-title`   | Defines and styles the toggle for each accordion item. Use `<a>` elements. |
| `.uk-accordion-icon`    | Defines and styles the icon part for each accordion item.                  |
| `.uk-accordion-content` | Defines the content part for each accordion item.                          |

<Ec project="kit" path="accordion.1" />

<Snippet project="kit" component="accordion.basic" />

## No collapsing

By default, all accordion items can be collapsed. To prevent this behavior and always maintain one open item, add the `collapsible: false` option to the attribute.

<Ec project="kit" path="accordion.2" />

<Snippet project="kit" component="accordion.no_collapsing" />

## Multiple open items

To display multiple content sections at the same time without one collapsing when the other one is opened, add the `multiple: true` option to the `data-uk-accordion` attribute.

<Ec project="kit" path="accordion.3" />

<Snippet project="kit" component="accordion.multiple" />

## Set open items

To specify which items should be opened initially, add the `.uk-open` class to the item. You can also use this to open multiple items. Just make sure to add the option `multiple: true` to the `data-uk-accordion` attribute.

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> Alternatively, you can open a single item by adding the `active: <index>` option to the `data-uk-accordion` attribute, e.g. `active: 1` to show the second element (the index is zero-based). Note that this will overwrite the `uk-open` class.

<Ec project="kit" path="accordion.4" />

<Snippet project="kit" component="accordion.set_open" />

## Component options

Any of these options can be applied to the component attribute. Separate multiple options with a semicolon. [Learn more](/docs/2.1/javascript#component-configuration)

## Accessibility

The Accordion component adheres to the [Accordion WAI-ARIA design pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/) and automatically sets the appropriate WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties.

- The _titles_ have an ID, the `button` role, the `aria-expanded` state and the `aria-controls` property set to the ID of the respective content.
- The _contents_ have an ID, the `region` role and the `aria-labelledby` property set to the ID of the respective title.

### Keyboard interaction

The Accordion component can be accessed through keyboard using the following keys.

- The <kbd>tab</kbd> or <kbd>shift+tab</kbd> keys navigate through accordion titles.
- The <kbd>enter</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd> key toggles the content of the focused title.
