## Usage

The custom select component is a web component built from scratch to enhance the native `<select>` tag. To get started, simply use the `<uk-select>` markup in your HTML code with one `<select data-fn="data-source" hidden></select>` tag as options reference.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.basic" />

## Capturing values

There are several ways to capture values from the `<uk-select>` component. The simplest approach is to add a `name` attribute to the component. When you do this, a hidden input field with the specified name will be automatically generated, allowing you to easily capture the selected value on your server.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.capturing_values" />

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> If you don't specify a `value` attribute for an `<option>` tag, it will default to using its text content as the value instead.

## Position

Because the `<uk-select>` component uses the [Drop](/docs/2.1/drop) component under the hood, we can leverage its positioning capabilities and position our dropdown anywhere we want. To position it, just use the `drop` attribute with your drop options.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.position" />

## Size modifiers

There are several size modifiers available. Just add one of the following classes to make the fake input smaller or larger.

| Class             | Description               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| `.uk-form-xsmall` | Applies extra small size. |
| `.uk-form-small`  | Applies small size.       |
| `.uk-form-medium` | Applies medium size.      |
| `.uk-form-large`  | Applies large size.       |

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.size" />

## Adding header

To add a header to your custom select component, use the `<optgroup>` tag, which will be automatically converted into a dropdown header, providing a seamless developer experience.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.adding_header" />

## Selecting multiple values

To enable the selection of multiple values, simply add the `multiple` attribute to the `<uk-select>` element. This will allow users to choose multiple options from the dropdown list.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.multiple" />

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> When utilizing the
`multiple` attribute, note that it will automatically append `[]` to the name of
your input. This is particularly useful when your server expects multiple
values, even if the user selects only one option. This ensures that your
server-side logic can properly handle the input, regardless of the number of
values selected.

## Prepopulating values

There are two ways to prepopulate values from the `<uk-select>` component. The simplest approach is to add a `selected` attribute to one or more of your `<option>` tags.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.prepopulated" />

### Manually setting value

Alternatively, if setting `selected` on individual `<option>` elements is not feasible, you can use the `value` attribute on the `<uk-select>` tag to prepopulate it with default values. This attribute accepts a comma-separated list of values, allowing you to set multiple defaults, such as `value="Mercedes-Benz,Bentley,Porsche,Lamborghini"`.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.prepopulated_1" />

<span class="uk-label uk-label-primary">Note</span> When both `value` and
`selected` are used, the `value` attribute takes precedence. Therefore, it's
recommended to use one method or the other to avoid conflicts.

## Disabling options

Similar to the native `<select>` tag, you can disable specific options in the custom select component by adding the `disabled` attribute to one or more of your `<option>` or `<optgroup>` tags. This allows you to prevent users from selecting certain options.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.disabling_options" />

## Reactivity

By default, the component is not reactive. This is a deliberate design choice, as using [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) can be computationally expensive. As a result, changes to the referenced `<select data-fn="data-source" hidden>` element will not trigger an update.

To enable reactivity, simply add the `data-reactive` attribute to the `<select data-fn="data-source" hidden>` tag. This will use [MutationObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver) under the hood to monitor the element for changes.

This feature is particularly useful when using libraries like HTMX, where you may need to dynamically update the options in the `<select data-fn="data-source" hidden>` element based on user interactions, such as searching for data or fetching new options from the server.

<Ec project="kit" path="select.1" />

## Searchable

To add a search box, simply add the `searchable` attribute. This will add an input field within the dropdown menu, enabling users to search for specific options. This feature is particularly useful when dealing with extensive lists, such as selecting a country from a long list of options.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.searchable" />

### Custom keywords

Sometimes, there are items that have related keywords that may be slightly off or awkward when included as anchor tags. For these use cases, we can leverage the `data-keywords` attribute.

For example, if we have a "Form" link but also want it to appear when users search for terms like "checkbox," "input," "toggle switch," etc., we can simply add a comma-separated list of terms like this: `data-keywords="apple, mango, lemon"`.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.custom_keywords" />

## Disable input

To prevent user input, add the `disabled` attribute to the `<uk-select>` element. This will disable the custom select, making it impossible for users to enter or modify its value.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.disabled" />

## Icon

[Todo]

## Options icon

To add icon to options, just add `data-icon` attribute with the name of the icon to your `<option>` tags.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.options_icon" />

## Error state

To indicate an error state in the form, simply add the `.uk-form-danger` class to the `cls` attribute. This will apply a "danger" state to the component, providing visual feedback to the user.

<Snippet project="kit" component="select.error" />

## Preventing layout shift

When loading Web Components, a brief delay may cause a flash of unstyled content. To mitigate this issue, consider setting a predefined height on the parent element to prevent layout shift and ensure a smooth user experience.
